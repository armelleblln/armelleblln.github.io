## My Story
I'm a passionate geologist and paleoclimate scientist based in Tübingen, Germany. With a deep love for understanding Earth's processes, I dedicate my work to uncovering the past climates and environments of our planet. My main interests cover isotope geochemistry, paleoclimatology, exogenous processes, and paleoenvironmental studies.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Geology from the University of Freiburg. My MSc thesis aimed at reconstructing the Holocene coastal dynamics of the Chanthaburi estuary in the Gulf of Thailand. 
I pursued my academic journey in 2021 with a PhD at [the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre](https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/sbik-f/ag-paleoclimate-and-paleoenvironment-dynamics/){target="_blank"} in Frankfurt am Main expending my knowledge in paleoclimate and geochemistry. 


My PhD project is part of the second phase of a DFG-funded SPP  ‘Mountain Building Processes in Four Dimensions (MB-4D)’.
The project, entitled ‘Reconstructing Eastward Propagation of Surface Uplift in the Alps: Integrating Stable Isotope Paleoaltimetry and Paleoclimate Modelling (REAL)’ aims at constraining the surface uplift history of the European Alps in a paleoclimatic context.   
My project focuses on the Western and Eastern Alps, along with extending the record for the Central Alps to pre-Miocene times. The research focuses on stable isotope-based paleoelevation and paleoclimate reconstructions (ẟ18O, ẟD, D47-D48). The obtained ẟ-ẟ paleoaltimetry and clumped isotope-derived paleotemperature records are coupled with an isotope tracking atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) performed by colleagues from the ‘Earth System Dynamics Group’ at the University of Tübingen.  


Since April 2025, I joined the [Climatology and the Biosphere group](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/abs/late-holocene-coastal-dynamics-south-of-the-chanthaburi-estuary-eastern-gulf-of-thailand/CA506FAE3DF018CE3D7D2AEA52C6F4C9){target="_blank"} at the university of Tübingen as a Research Scientist. My main tasks include stable isotope analysis of water samples and the active monitoring of cave systems to investigate environmental processes.

When I am not working in the lab, I am playing cello, boxing, crafting, or hiking (in the Alps).
