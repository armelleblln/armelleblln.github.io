    "text": "I am a geologist whose main interests cover sedimentary geology, exogenous processes and paleoenvironmental studies.\nMy PhD project is part of the second phase of a DFG-funded SPP ‘Mountain Building Processes in Four Dimensions (MB-4D)’.\nThe project, entitled ‘Reconstructing Eastward Propagation of Surface Uplift in the Alps: Integrating Stable Isotope Paleoaltimetry and Paleoclimate Modelling (REAL)’ aims at constraining the surface uplift history of the European Alps in a paleoclimatic context.\nMy project focuses on the Western and Eastern Alps, along with extending the record for the Central Alps to pre-Miocene times. The research focuses on stable isotope-based paleoelevation and paleoclimate reconstructions (ẟ18O, ẟD, D47-D48). The obtained ẟ-ẟ paleoaltimetry and clumped isotope-derived paleotemperature records are coupled with an isotope tracking atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) performed by colleagues from the ‘Earth System Dynamics Group’ at the University of Tübingen.\nWhen I am not working on the Alpine surface uplift history, I am playing cello, boxing or crafting !\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     twitter\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n  \n    \n     Google Scholar"
